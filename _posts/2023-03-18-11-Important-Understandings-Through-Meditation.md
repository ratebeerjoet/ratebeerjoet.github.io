<H1>11 Important Things You Can Learn Through Meditation</h1>

Most of us have read the many studies coming out every day supporting meditation's ability to offer calm, focus, and relief to those of us under life or work stress, and/or those diagnosed with ADHD or Depression. We've also probably heard the futility of trying force calm. The quote, "Muddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone" by Alan Watts is often shared online with all of us achievement-minded practitioners asking questions about meditational "goals". Zen's "just sitting" (shikantaza) practice might feel just as frustrating. How are we supposed to do something, like meditate, and achieve the published benefits if we've tried just sitting there, "failed", and receive no corrective instruction?

What I've found is that it's helpful for many of us who practice meditation regularly, and many others who wish to try, to have a more complete roadmap. While some of the following ideas will make sense to anyone, truly knowing them experientially through meditation, is where the real additional benefits emerge. 

One big caveat here is that the scientific benefits of meditation have been observed in beginners without measuring whether subjects have come to any of these intermediate to advanced understandings. You're still getting benefits from your eight week course!

<h4>Impermanence</h4>
Impermanence is the understanding that all things are in a constant state of change and are never static. This insight is important because it helps to overcome attachment to things or situations, as one realizes that everything is temporary. Practicing mindfulness of the breath or body sensations can help to cultivate an awareness of impermanence.

<h4>Non-Self</h4>
Non-self is the realization that there is no permanent, unchanging self or soul, and that our sense of self is an illusion. This insight is important because it helps to reduce the ego's influence and attachment to self-identity. Practicing mindfulness of thoughts and emotions can help to cultivate an awareness of non-self.

<h4>Interdependence</h4>
Interdependence is the understanding that all things are connected and depend on each other. This insight is important because it helps to develop compassion and empathy for others, as well as to understand the consequences of our actions. Practicing loving-kindness meditation can help to cultivate an awareness of interdependence.

<h4>Equanimity</h4>
Equanimity is the ability to remain balanced and calm in the face of difficult situations or emotions. This insight is important because it helps to reduce reactivity to stress and negative emotions. Practicing mindfulness of thoughts and emotions, as well as loving-kindness meditation, can help to cultivate equanimity.

<h4>Non-Attachment</h4>
Non-attachment is the ability to let go of attachment to elements of our personality, our fear of change, and desire for satisfaction from external things. This insight is important because it helps to reduce suffering caused by becoming unstabilized by fear, greed, or not feeling what we're doing is truly in line with who we are. Practicing mindfulness of thoughts and emotions, as well as loving-kindness meditation, can help to cultivate non-attachment.

<h4>Compassion</h4>
Compassion is the ability to feel and understand the suffering of others, and to respond with kindness and empathy. This insight is important because it helps to develop positive relationships and social connections. Practicing loving-kindness meditation and compassion meditation can help to cultivate compassion.

<h4>Non-Judgment</h4>
Non-judgment is the ability to observe thoughts and emotions without attaching labels or value judgments. This insight is important because it helps to reduce negative self-talk and increase self-acceptance. Practicing mindfulness of thoughts and emotions can help to cultivate non-judgment.

<h4>Acceptance</h4>
Acceptance is the ability to accept and acknowledge difficult situations or emotions without resistance or judgment. This insight is important because it helps to reduce suffering caused by resistance or denial. Practicing mindfulness of thoughts and emotions can help to cultivate acceptance.

<h4>Gratitude</h4>
Gratitude is the ability to appreciate and express gratitude for the positive aspects of life. This insight is important because it helps to cultivate positive emotions and increase resilience. Practicing gratitude meditation or keeping a gratitude journal can help to cultivate gratitude.

<h4>Forgiveness</h4>
Forgiveness is the ability to forgive oneself and others for past mistakes or transgressions. This insight is important because it helps to reduce negative emotions and increase compassion. Practicing forgiveness meditation or therapy can help to cultivate forgiveness.

<h4>Presence</h4>
Presence is the ability to be fully present and engaged in the present moment without distraction or judgment. This insight is important because it helps to increase focus, attention, and awareness. Practicing mindfulness of the breath or body sensations can help to cultivate presence.

These insights are valuable for cultivating positive emotions, reducing negative emotions, increasing resilience, and developing positive relationships.  While practicing mindfulness meditation confers benefits regardless of having these insights, many of us feel it helpful to have a roadmap. Happy trails!
